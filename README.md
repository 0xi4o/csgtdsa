# A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms

Implementations of data structures and algorithms from the book [A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms by Jay Wengrow](https://pragprog.com/titles/jwdsal2/a-common-sense-guide-to-data-structures-and-algorithms-second-edition/).

Code for algorithms is not production code and is probably not the best implementation. They're written purely for learning how things work. For the same reason, I've tried as much as possible to only use Golang primitives and not use the functionality from the standard library or third-party packages.
